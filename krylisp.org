    I am going to give Participle a try. In a prior attempt I used gocc, but
    ... I wasn't really happy with it, I don't remember why.
    [2025-02-13 Do 15:44]
    After a long period of procrastination and banging my head against the
    desk I have finally started to understand how participle works and how to
    use it, and now that I am over that hump, I have to say it's pretty nice,
    at least so far.
